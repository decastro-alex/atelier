## What is Atelier?
Atelier is a simple customer and order management system written
especially with photographers in mind.

It's designed to accommodate the needs of a small company with 4-5
users and has been running practically with no maintenance since May
2008 (exactly six years at the time of writing).

It's now being re-written in Python.

## Can I use it too?

Yes you can. We release the source code as open source under the GPLv3
in the hope that it might be useful for others too, either as a simple
customer & order system or as a show case of an application using
Python and Flask.

See the [COPYING](COPYING) file for more information on licensing.

## What do I need to run it?

You need a Python 2.7 runtime environment a MySQL compatible database,
like [Percona](http://percona.com).

Cheers,
